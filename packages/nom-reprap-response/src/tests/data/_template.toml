# This template is used to create test fixtures for each supported firmware
#
# If you have an unsupported firmware you can help by copying this template and 
# filling in the values you get back from your from your 3D printer for each scenario
# (eg. Use Octoprint to send a "M115" and record the response under firmware: m115_firmware_info).
#
# These test fixtures are linked by adding a test to tests/mod.rs. If your unsure how to do this
# that's ok, just having the fields completed in this file should help a bunch!
